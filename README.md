## Overview

This repository contains a variety of programs written in C and C++ that cover topics such as sorting algorithms, search algorithms, data structures, pattern printing, and more. Each program is self-contained and can be run independently.

## Getting Started

To get started with these programs, you can clone the repository to your local machine using Git:


git clone https://github.com/muskan-Scripts/C-Programs.git
cd C-Programs

Make sure you have a C/C++ compiler installed on your machine. You can compile and run the programs using the following commands:

### Compiling a C Program
gcc -o program_name program_name.c
./program_name

###Compiling a C++ Program
g++ -o program_name program_name.cpp
./program_name

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have a program that you would like to add or an improvement to an existing program, feel free to open a pull request.
